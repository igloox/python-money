# This is a simplified version of the original script that generates version
# numbers along the lines of [tag].[number of additional commits]
# Provided the tag is numeric, the version number should be pep-440 compliant.
#
# To use this script, simply import it your setup.py file, and use the
# results of get_git_version() as your package version:
#
# from version import *
#
# setup(
#     version=get_git_version(),
#     .
#     .
#     .
# )
#
# This will automatically update the RELEASE-VERSION file, if
# necessary.  Note that the RELEASE-VERSION file should *not* be
# checked into git; please add it to your top-level .gitignore file.
#
# You'll probably want to distribute the RELEASE-VERSION file in your
# sdist tarballs; to do this, just create a MANIFEST.in file that
# contains the following line:
#
#   include RELEASE-VERSION
